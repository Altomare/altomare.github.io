## System ROMs

### Monitor

The Otrona boot ROM (U252) contains the following features:
* Read first floppy sector into 0xFE00 and attempt to boot on it
* Terminal mode
* System diagnostics

It is usually on a 2732 EPROM, but the socket also accepts 2764s.

### Character

The character ROM (U416) is the same on all the Otronas I've seen so far. From early AttachÃ©s to late 8:16s.
It is usually labeled "CG 500".

MD5: `346258b1cc3e3e88fa7e7e0b6a1984e7`

The above picture contains, in order:
* [Alternate-1] Forms ruling set
* [Standard] ASCII upper and lower case
* [Alternate-2] Greek lower case and math
* [Alternate-3] Greek upper case and math


## CP/M Operating System

The CP/M operating system is contained in the first 3 tracks (head 0) of a system diskette.
The first sector contains a bootloader, which will be loaded and executed by the system ROM.
This bootloader will then load all the remaining operating system from the floppy into memory.

From BIOS source:
> [Boot sector is] loaded into FE00h by PROM.
> Boot code will be saved in sector 1 of track 0 and is [...] one sector length ahead of the CCP.

Floppy layout:
```
0X0000 - 0x01FF (1 sector, 512)   = BIOS boot sector
0X0200 - 0x09FF (4 sectors, 2k)   = CCP
0X0A00 - 0x17FF (7 sectors, 3.5k) = BDOS
0x1800 - 0x3BFF (18 sectors, 9k)  = Rest of BIOS
```

Memory layout (64KB total):
```
0x0000 - 0x00FF = CP/M Buffers, registers & instructions
0x0100 - 0xC3FF = TPA: Transient Program Area
0xC400 - 0xCBFF = CCP: Console Command Processor
0xCC00 - 0xD9FF = BDOS: Basic Disk Operating System
0xDA00 - 0xFFFF = BIOS: Basic Input/Output System
```

### Versions

Below is a list of the OS versions I came across, along with the machine revision they came with:
